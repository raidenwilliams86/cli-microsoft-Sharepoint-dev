## Remarks

Deleting a site collection is by default asynchronous and depending on the current state of Microsoft 365, might take up to few minutes. If you're building a script with steps that require the site to be fully deleted, you should use the `--wait` flag. When using this flag, the `spo site remove` command will keep running until it received confirmation from Microsoft 365 that the site has been fully deleted.

## Examples

Remove the specified site and place it in the Recycle Bin

```sh
spo site remove --url https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/demosite
```

Remove the site without moving it to the Recycle Bin

```sh
spo site remove --url https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/demosite --skipRecycleBin
```

Remove the previously deleted site from the Recycle Bin

```sh
spo site remove --url https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/demosite --fromRecycleBin
```

Remove the site without moving it to the Recycle Bin and wait for completion

```sh
spo site remove --url https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/demosite --wait --skipRecycleBin
